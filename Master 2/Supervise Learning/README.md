# Supervised-Learning-and-Data-Challenge
*November 2023*

The project entails the application of supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques to tackle a regression and a multiclass classification challenges. This work is a part of the Advanced Supervised Learning and Data Challenge within the second year of the MSc Mathematics and AI program at Paris-Saclay University.  


## Regression problem
It involves a regression problem centered on predicting the quality of wine, rated on a scale from 1 to 10.

## Multiclass classification problem
It involves a celestial objects classification, where there are three classes(galaxy, star or quasar).

## Methodology
